        <p> The last two years have seen disruption and change like never before. Lockdowns, pandemics, increased
            digitisation, working from home and a war for talent.</p>

        <p>Against this backdrop, more is now spent on Martech than on marketing people, but many projects and people
            are left with increased levels of dissatisfaction and frustration.</p>

        <p> This is leading to nearly a 1/3 of organisations migrating from one Martech platform to another at anyone
            time, whilst a staggering 60% of organisations deploy technology with little thought to integration and
            organisational adoption.</p>

        <h1>Digital Transformation Webinar</h1>
        <p> With official ONS figures recording over 1 million UK job vacancies in July 2021, there has never been such
            a war for talent. The recruitment market has never seen such opportunity, whilst being so competitive in
            what is a very candidate-led market. Recruitment industry marketers must find innovative ways to
            differentiate, deliver seamless customer experiences and then demonstrate their impact back to the business.
