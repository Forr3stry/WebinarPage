            <h1>This is a left aligned grid module</h1>
            <p> The last two years have seen disruption and change like never before. Lockdowns, pandemics,
                increased
                digitisation, working from home and a war for talent.</p><br />

            <p>Against this backdrop, more is now spent on Martech than on marketing people, but many projects and
                people are left with increased levels of dissatisfaction and frustration.<br /> This is leading to
                nearly a 1/3 of organisations migrating from one Martech platform to another at
                anyone time, whilst a staggering 60% of organisations deploy technology with little thought to
                integration and organisational adoption.</p><br />
